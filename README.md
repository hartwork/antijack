# What is antijack?

**antijack** was inspired by [ttyjack](https://github.com/jwilk/ttyjack)
and is its counterpart in some sense, hence the name.

**antijack**'s mission is threefold:

- allow execution of a program in a way where it *cannot* inject
  commands via ioctls `TIOCSTI` and/or `TIOCLINUX`
  into the surrounding controlling terminal,
  e.g. try `antijack ttyjack echo nope`.
- generate and dump a seccomp syscall filter (a BPF program)
  that blocks ioctls `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX`
  into a file for use with
  e.g. [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)
  a la `bwrap --seccomp 3 [..] 3< <(antijack --dump /dev/stdout)`.
- demo mitigation at syscall level for Linux leveraging libseccomp.
  **May not be enough!**
